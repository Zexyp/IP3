# Browse
Very funny nudity inspired database browser.

## Initial Setup

### Libraries
Use the following command to get all the dependencies.
```
composer update
```

### Configuration
There is a file called `template.json` in the `config` directory.
Fill in the database connection details and rename the file to `config.json`

### Database
Use the file `database_setup.sql` to set up necessary tables. Now you don't have to touch SQL.
If you want to change the database name you can do it in the first few lines.
